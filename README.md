# Summarization
Implementation of different summarization algorithms applied to legal case judgements.

This repository contains the implementations and reproductions of various summarization algorithms applied to legal case documents, and the codebase for the paper "A Comparative Study of Summarization Algorithms applied to Legal Case Judgments" to appear in the 41st European Conference on Information Retrieval (ECIR), 2019.

Types of algorithms:

* Supervised & Unsupervised, domain-specific
* Neural Networks based
